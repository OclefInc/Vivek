      <p>
        In the realm of piano pedagogy, understanding the diverse needs of students is crucial. Each project type has a specific role in shaping the learning experience. By categorizing projects into distinct types, educators and contributors can better appreciate the multifaceted nature of piano education and tailor their teaching approaches accordingly.

      <p>
        This classification highlights the focus of teachers at various stages in students' piano journey.  We hope to foster a discussion of pedagogical practices within the community.
